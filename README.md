# COSMIC HARMONY - SWE 432 - FALL 2023
![Alt text](assets/graphics/logo.png)<br>
We are a web-based radio station called Cosmic Harmony. We are new to the radio industry and currently aiming to build a user-base of listeners teen-aged and up. Our goal as a radio station is to give listeners music they already like while also expanding their taste by introducing them to a variety of music genres they may like based on their selected preferences. Our radio runs 24/7, seven days a week. Our building is in Northern Virginia, but since weâ€™re web-based, we can be accessed from anywhere. Staff-wise, we are a mid-sized company (about 100 employees). To gain revenue, we run sponsored ads occasionally. We also offer our users at-a-glance information regarding traffic, news alerts, and trending social media feeds.
